# Silly Cat Trader Icons

Updates Trader icons to a much better looking alternative.

## Description

Replaces the server method that displays the trader icons with a custom method that uses custom image files for the trader icons. These can be changed out to any icons(images) desired provided you follow the steps to ensure that they all match filetypes and are of equal or very similar size.

This mod supports traders from other mods as well. I will attempt to do my best to keep up with the ever changing mod list out there, but I cannot make any guarantees.

## Installation

^^^ PRIMARY INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

  1. Extract the contents of the zip file into the root of your SPT folder. It will automatically place the file into your mods folder.
  2. This mod should be loaded after all other mods that add new traders.
  3. If you suspect that this mod is loading before an additional trader is loaded, the load order may need to be changed by adding an additional "Z" or more to the folder name.
  4. After altering the name, delete BSG temp files using the settings menu in the Aki.Launcher.exe program.
